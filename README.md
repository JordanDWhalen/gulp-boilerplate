# gulp-boilerplate
Love [@tyvdh's](https://github.com/tyvdh) [gulp-boilerplate](https://github.com/tyvdh/gulp-boilerplate). I've been using it for quite a while now, and Ive only ever made the smallest of changes.

- Swapped out Livereload for Livereload Server
- Added Velocity.js as a default library.
